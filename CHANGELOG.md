## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Per-Language Model Customization**: Each target language can now use a different AI model for translation, enabling optimal model selection per language pair.
- **Progressive Translation Display**: Translation results now appear incrementally as each language completes, rather than waiting for all translations to finish. Skeleton loaders dynamically adjust based on remaining translations.
- **Model Selector Popover**: Introduced a new interactive UI component for selecting AI models on a per-language basis.
- **Model Info Display**: Translation cards now display the current model being used for each language.
- **Enhanced shadcn/ui Integration**: Added new components for improved UI consistency:
  - Command palette component
  - Dropdown menu component
  - Popover component
  - Scroll area component
  - Select component
  - Sheet component
  - Tabs component
  - Textarea component
  - Tooltip component

### Changed

- **UI Component Migration**: Migrated all major UI components to shadcn/ui for better consistency, accessibility, and maintainability.
  - Refactored `Header` component with shadcn/ui primitives
  - Refactored `LanguageSwitcher` component with improved interactions
  - Completely rebuilt `ModelSelectorPopover` with new per-language model selection
  - Enhanced `TranslationCard` component with model info display
  - Improved `TranslationInput` component with refined language chips
- **Removed Legacy Components**: Deprecated custom `portal-dropdown` component in favor of shadcn/ui alternatives.

### Improved

- **Interaction Design**: Added cursor-pointer styling to all clickable elements for better user experience and accessibility.
- **Language Chips**: Refined visual design and interaction feedback for language selection chips.
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript type definitions for better development experience.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-11

### CI/CD

- **GitHub Pages**: Added workflow configuration for automated deployment to GitHub Pages.
- **Build**: Configured build settings to support static site generation.

### Documentation

- **i18n**: Fully translated `README.zh.md` to Chinese for better accessibility.
- **Updates**: Updated repository URLs and removed legacy links.
- **Clarification**: Added notes about optional API keys for local models.

### Improved

- **Mobile UX**: Enhanced navigation in Settings Modal. Pressing the back button on mobile now closes the modal or navigates back one level instead of closing the page.
- **Robustness**: Improved error handling for encrypted settings. Corrupted data now triggers an automatic reset instead of crashing the app.
- **UI**: Optimized dropdown positioning algorithm. Menus now automatically adjust to stay within the viewport, fixing overflow issues on small screens.
- **Compatibility**: Improved compatibility for mobile browsers and non-secure contexts (HTTP).

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the Settings Modal would flicker or close unexpectedly when switching views on mobile.
- Fixed a potential crash loop caused by decryption failures in `localStorage`.
- Fixed Model Selector dropdown overflowing off-screen on mobile devices.
- Fixed dialog visibility issues on mobile devices.
